# 23daysOfCode
I code consistently in the next 23 days
23daysOfCode is an intiative with a group of friends from novice to expert to code consistently for 23 days.
The idea is not to write the largest amount of code each day but to develop the habit of coding on a regular basis.
Since this is a side-fun work, I intend to spend not more than an hour each day on this repository. 
My coding languages will be in python, java and C++. Maybe others might come up.
I might occasionally include personal codes and school work completed during this time.
